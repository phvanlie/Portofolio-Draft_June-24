                        Checkers is a strategy game that pits two opponents against each other.
                        <br>
                        The two players, facing their 10 pieces each, battle until one of them has all their pieces captured by their opponent.
                        The game is governed by several rules.
                        <br>
                        Moves are made diagonally.
                        The checkerboard, the game's playing surface, indicates possible moves with alternating colored squares.
                        A piece can only move forward, and it becomes a king when it reaches the far end of the opponent's side.
                        Once transformed, the king gains freedom of movement and becomes more formidable.
                        It can then move both forward and backward at will.
                        <br>
                        Some rules are not present in the game.
                        For example, a king cannot move over multiple squares.

                        Set up an automatic grid creation system to provide the number of non-empty cells at the start of the game.
                        Then verify that the proposed grid has a unique solution.
                        The program can create varied grids and the number of filled cells at the start can be variable.

                        The project involved creating a Roulette game.
                        <br>
                        The given instructions were: 
                        <br>
                        "Create a program that manages a list of players playing roulette.
                        The minimum bet is 1 euro, and the maximum bet is 1000 euros.
                        A player can join or leave the table at the end of each round.
                        Subsequently, create a program that plays roulette using the "classic martingales".
                        We researched on the internet to better understand what "classic martingales" means.
                        After verification, this information allowed us to create the program.
                        Thus, the roulette martingale known as the classic martingale involves betting on a simple chance at roulette, either even or odd.
                        After each loss, the player must double their bet.
                        If they lose again, they bet the initial amount doubled, and so on, until they win.
                        In this case, they recover their losses and initial bets.
                        With a 50% chance of winning, the player might think they will eventually win; when they win, they are reimbursed for everything they have played, plus their initial bet."
